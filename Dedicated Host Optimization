Scenario:

Finding: An EC2 instance was running on a Dedicated Host for a non-compliance workload.

Action Taken: Migrated the instance to a Shared VPC model.

Cost Impact: Saved $1,400 per month per region.

Recommendation:

Review all workloads on dedicated hosts and ensure they are compliant.

Move non-compliance or non-critical workloads to shared instances to optimize costs.

Implement tagging to track instances running on dedicated hosts.
