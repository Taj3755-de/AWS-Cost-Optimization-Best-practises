Finding: WorkSpaces were set to Auto Stop mode (e.g., auto-stop every 2 hours), but some users consistently used their WorkSpaces beyond the advised hours. This caused higher monthly costs compared to Always-On mode.

Action Taken:

      Reviewed usage patterns for all WorkSpaces in Auto Stop mode.

      Identified users exceeding 8 hours/day or 4 hours/day thresholds.

      Switched eligible WorkSpaces to Always-On mode to optimize performance and cost.

Recommendation:

      Regularly monitor WorkSpaces usage to determine if Auto Stop or Always-On is more cost-effective.

      Adjust modes based on actual user behavior rather than default settings.

      Document changes and track monthly cost impact to validate optimization.
