Finding:    Multiple unused or unassociated resources across the AWS environment were incurring costs or cluttering the account:

      EBS Volumes    (unattached)
      Snapshots    (left from old AMIs)
      Elastic IPs    (not in use)
      Security Groups    (unused or redundant)
      VPC Peering Connections    (unused)
      ENIs    (unused network interfaces)
      Route Tables    (orphaned)
      VPCs    (unused or obsolete)

    Action Taken:   

  1. Identified all unassociated or unused resources using scripts and AWS CLI.
  2. Cleaned up orphaned and unused resources systematically.
  3. Implemented tagging and auditing policies to prevent future clutter.

    Cost Impact:   

  * Reduced ongoing costs from idle storage, unused IPs, and orphaned infrastructure.
  * Improved operational hygiene and reduced risk of misconfigured or orphaned resources.

    Recommendation:   

  * Schedule regular audits for orphaned or unused resources.
  * Implement automation for detecting and alerting on unassociated volumes, snapshots, and other idle resources.
  * Maintain proper tagging and documentation to quickly identify obsolete resources.
