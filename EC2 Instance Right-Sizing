Finding: Several EC2 instances were running on older generation instance types (e.g., m5) across multiple environments.

Action Taken: Migrated instances to newer generation types (m6 or m6a), which provide better performance per cost.

Cost Impact: Reduced cost by $2â€“6 per instance per month while improving performance.

Recommendation:

Regularly review instance types and consider upgrading to newer generations.

Right-size instances based on actual CPU, memory, and workload requirements.

Track performance improvements post-migration to validate efficiency gains.

Note:
m6 instance family is cheaper than m5, but not with m7 families
