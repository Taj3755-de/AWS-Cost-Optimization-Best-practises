Monthly billing reports showed unexpected high charges on specific services, but the root cause was unclear without detailed breakdowns.


        Enabled AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) with daily granularity and service-level breakdown.

        Imported CUR data into S3/Redshift/QuickSight for detailed analysis.

        Analyzed costs by individual services, linked accounts, and tags to identify:

        Idle resources

        Orphaned infrastructure

        Over-provisioned services

        Highlighted services with disproportionate cost compared to usage.



        Identified cost-saving opportunities for EC2, EBS, WorkSpaces, RDS, and S3.

        Provided a data-driven basis for right-sizing, snapshot cleanup, and policy optimization.



        Regularly analyze CUR reports at the service and tag level.

        Use automated dashboards (QuickSight, Athena, or Redshift) to monitor trends.

        Integrate findings into monthly cost optimization initiatives.
