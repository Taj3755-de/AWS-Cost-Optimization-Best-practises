Finding: Numerous EBS snapshots were not cleaned up due to a corrupted DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager) policy, causing unnecessary monthly costs.

Action Taken:

      Migrated snapshot management to AWS Backup.

      Properly configured backup retention periods according to DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan).

      Wrote a custom script to identify and clean up unregulated snapshots.

      Cost Impact: Saved $40,000 per month.

Recommendation:

      Regularly audit DLM and backup policies to prevent misconfigurations.

      Automate snapshot analysis to identify orphaned or uncleaned snapshots.

      Align backup retention with business and compliance requirements to avoid over-retention.
